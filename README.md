# Dungeon Crawler Game built with React.js

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification. 

## Objectives:

- I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.

- All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.

- I can move throughout a map, discovering items.

- I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.

- Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.

- When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.

- When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.

- When I find and beat the boss, I win.

- The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.
